#Input is a function
#It allows a user to input data into a program via the keyboard
#It can also display strings

#e.g.
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Your name is", name)

#This will prompt the user to enter a string
#The value the user enters will then be stored in the variable 'name'

#Here are more examples:
name = input("\nEnter your name again: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
favouriteColour = input("Enter your favourite colour: ")
print("\nYour name is", name, "and you are", age, "years old, and your favouite colour is", favouriteColour + ".")

#When using 'input', python always stores the data as a string
#Therefore, use the 'int' function to do mathamatics with inputs, e.g.
age = int(input("\nEnter your age again: "))
print("Your age doubled would be", age*2 + ".")
#This is called 'casting' and can be done with other data types too, e.g.
str()
int()
float()
